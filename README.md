vercel
```

### Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder to Netlify
```

Update `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` to your production backend URL before deployment.

---

##  Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" API errors
- Check if backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` matches your backend URL
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: User not logged in after refresh
- Verify JWT token is saved in localStorage
- Check if `localStorage.getItem('token')` returns a valid token
- Try logging in again

### Issue: Case arguments not showing
- Verify case has arguments submitted
- Check if verdict is generated (required to view arguments)
- Check backend logs for errors

---

##  Notes

- All API calls use JWT token in Authorization header
- Token expires in 30 days
- Case arguments limited to 5 per side
- AI verdict requires both sides to submit at least one argument
